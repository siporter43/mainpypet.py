https://alissa-huskey.github.io/python-class/exercises/flashcards.html#part-9-start-the-play-function
Part 1: Make CSV (filetype/space to keep it)
Part 2: Start flashcards.py (create workspace to create and call flashcards)
Part 3: Start load_csv() (create this new fncn)
Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
Part 6: Return the card data to main()Â¶
Part 7: Remove extra whitespace
Part 8: Skip the Header row
Part 9: Start the play() fncn
Part 10: Go through each card in random order
Part 11: Test the User
Part 12: Scorekeeping
Part 13: Prettifying flashcards
Part 14: Wrap long questions
Part 15: Add topics menu
    at the top of your file
        [ ]Make a list assigned to the global variable TOPICS
    menu()
        [x]write a menu() function
        [x]assign TOPICS to a list of Path objects in your flashcards directory 
        using the .iterdir() method
        [x]print an error message if no files are found in your flashcards directory
        [x]print the filename minus the .csv extension for each Path object 
        in the TOPICS list, next to a number
        [x]print a special option "all" with a menu selection of 0
        [x]make a list assigned to the variable selection
        [x]get input from the user asking them to choose one or more topics 
        and assign it to a variable choices
        [x]use the .split() method to split choices into multiple items on whitespace
        [x]iterate over each response and assign to choice:
            [x]if the response is "0", return TOPICS
            [x]convert choice to an int and subtract 1
            [x]get the item from TOPICS at the choice index and append it to selection list
        [x]return the selection list
    in main()
        [ ]at the beginning of the function, make an empty cards list
        [ ]call menu() and assign the returned value to the variable paths
        [ ]remove the line where you previously defined the path to your .csv file
        [ ]iterate over paths and assign each element to the variable path:
            [ ]call load_csv() with the path argument
            [ ]append the returned value to cards using the .extend() method
