https://alissa-huskey.github.io/python-class/exercises/flashcards.html#part-9-start-the-play-function
Part 1: Make CSV (filetype/space to keep it)
Part 2: Start flashcards.py (create workspace to create and call flashcards)
Part 3: Start load_csv() (create this new fncn)
Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
Part 6: Return the card data to main()Â¶
    Have load_csv() put all of the card dictionaries into one big cards list and return that to main().
        in load_csv(), before the readlines() loop
            [x] make an empty list assigned to a variable named cards

        in load_csv(), at the end of the readlines() loop
            [x] use the .append() method on the cards list with the argument card

        in load_csv(), after the loop
            [x] return cards

        in main()
            [x] if the cards list is falsy, return
            [x] otherwise, print the cards list for temporary debugging
