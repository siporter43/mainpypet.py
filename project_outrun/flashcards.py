https://alissa-huskey.github.io/python-class/exercises/flashcards.html#part-9-start-the-play-function
Part 1: Make CSV (filetype/space to keep it)
Part 2: Start flashcards.py (create workspace to create and call flashcards)
Part 3: Start load_csv() (create this new fncn)
Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
Part 6: Return the card data to main()Â¶
Part 7: Remove extra whitespace
Part 8: Skip the Header row
Part 9: Start the play() fncn
Part 10: Go through each card in random order
Part 11: Test the User
Part 12: Scorekeeping
Part 13: Prettifying flashcards
    throughout your file
        [x] get rid of any debug print() statements
    at the top of the file
        [x] make a global variable WIDTH and set it to around 75
    in play
        [x] print a line to the beginning and end of each card
        [x] add some extra newlines around various elements
        [x] center any string by calling the .center() method 
        on it and pass the argument WIDTH. For example, the card["front"] line.
        [/] right align any string by calling the .rjust() method on it 
            and passing the argument WIDTH. For example, the card x of y line.
        [ ] print "score of total" after the end of each card
