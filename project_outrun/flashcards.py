Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
Part 6: Return the card data to main()Â¶
Part 7: Remove extra whitespace
Part 8: Skip the Header row
Part 9: Start the play() fncn
Part 10: Go through each card in random order
Part 11: Test the User
Part 12: Scorekeeping
Part 13: Prettifying flashcards
Part 14: Wrap long questions
Part 15: Add topics menu
Part 16: Allow Answers with commas
    at the top of your file
        [x] import the csv module
    in load_csv() after opening your file
        [x] Create a new csv reader like so:
        [x] Instead of iterating over fh.readlines(), iterate over the reader object, 
        # which will yields a list of values in each row.        
    at the beginning of the loop:
        [x] check if row is empty, and if it is:
            [x] continue
